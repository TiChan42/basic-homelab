# Playbook: Services - Home Assistant OS (VM)
# Description: Provisions a Proxmox KVM virtual machine running Home Assistant
#              Operating System with USB passthrough, Zigbee2MQTT, Matter, and
#              automated NAS backup/restore.
#
# Process:
# 1. Proxmox VM Provisioning (localhost):
#    - Downloads the HAOS qcow2 image.
#    - Creates a UEFI-based KVM VM (q35 machine type).
#    - Imports the disk image and configures boot.
#    - Passes through USB devices (e.g. Sonoff Zigbee dongle).
#    - Starts VM and waits for HA API to become available.
#
# 2. Home Assistant Configuration (localhost → HA API):
#    - Completes onboarding (creates admin user).
#    - Configures static IP via Supervisor Network API.
#    - Installs Add-ons: Zigbee2MQTT, Matter Server.
#    - Configures Zigbee2MQTT to use the external Mosquitto broker.
#    - Configures MQTT integration in HA.
#
# 3. Backup Concept (localhost cron → HA API → NAS):
#    - A cron job on the Proxmox host triggers HA backups via the API.
#    - The backup file is downloaded and stored on the NAS mount.
#    - Numbered rotation with validation before promotion.
#
# Architecture Note – USB Passthrough:
#   The Sonoff Zigbee USB dongle is passed through to the HA VM,
#   NOT to the MQTT broker container. The data flow is:
#     Zigbee Dongle (USB) → Zigbee2MQTT (HA Add-on) → Mosquitto (LXC)
#   Mosquitto only receives MQTT messages and does not need USB access.
#
# Inventory Requirements (in 'homeassistant' group):
#   - ha_vm_id            (unique Proxmox VMID)
#   - ha_vm_name          (Proxmox VM Name, matches inventory_hostname)
#   - ansible_host        (static IP for HA)
